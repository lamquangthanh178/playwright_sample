# Playwright Sample.
This Playwright framework follows the Page Object Model (POM) for both UI and API testing. It integrates Allure Report for detailed test reporting and supports CI/CD with GitHub Actions, triggering tests automatically on code push to the main branch. Additionally, it sends Slack notifications upon test completion.
## Key Features
âœ… POM Design â€“ Reusable page objects for UI & API tests

âœ… Allure Reporting â€“ Generates test reports with screenshots & logs

âœ… CI/CD Integration â€“ Runs tests on GitHub Actions when pushing code

âœ… Slack Notifications â€“ Alerts team on test run completion
